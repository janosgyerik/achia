title: Air Pollution and Climate Change Health Impact Assessment
---
{% include JB/setup %}

Air pollution poses a significant public health burden. It accounts for about 1.4% of the total mortality in the world, which represents several hundred thousands of premature deaths and hospitalizations each year in Europe. The Air Pollution and Climate Change Health Impact Assessment project investigates how this would evolve in the future, in a context of changing climate. 

The project is based on an interdisciplinary approach. Eight partners including climate scientists, air pollution modelers, epidemiologists and public health scientists work together during two years to apply state of the art climate, air quality, and health modelling tools to assess future health impacts of ozone and PM2.5 under different IPCCs scenario of climate change. 

The project will provide results at three spatial scales: the whole World, Europe, and the Ile-de-France region, using consistent methodologies. Present health impacts of ozone and PM2.5 will be compared to the expected health impacts in the period 2030-2050, under alternative climate mitigation pathways. 

Comparison across four IPCC representative concentration pathways at the global scale will answer the question, “what are the global health implications of various greenhouse gas control policies?” Models at the European and Ile-de-France scale will take into account European and Ile-de-France emissions targets. These results will be of direct value to national and local decision makers in quantifying health benefits of global and regional emissions pathways.

Substantial and economically efficient improvements in public health may be achieved with well-planned strategies to improve air pollution, while also mitigating climate change.
